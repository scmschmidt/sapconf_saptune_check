# sapconf_saptune_check

This tool checks if sapconf or saptune is set up correctly. +
It will check among other things

  * the package versions,
  * the status of the systemd services of sapconf and tuned,
  * the tuned profile,
  * the sapconf profile (sapconf v5),
  * if solutions or notes are applied for saptune
  * for leftover configs from package updates 
  * for .rpmnew/.rpmsave files of configs

In case of a misconfiguration some hints are given to rectify the problem.
Please follow the hints from top to down to mitigate side effects.

**It will not dig deeper to check if the tuning itself is working correctly!**

Checking saptune (tuned-based)
==============================
[ OK ]  saptune package has version 2.0.3
[FAIL]  sapconf.service is active               --> Run 'systemctl stop sapconf.service' to stop the tuning now.
[FAIL]  sapconf.service is enabled              --> Run 'systemctl disable sapconf.service' to deactivate sapconf at boot.
[ OK ]  tuned package has version 2.4.1
[FAIL]  tuned.service is inactive               --> Run 'saptune daemon start' to start the tuning now.
[FAIL]  tuned.service is disabled               --> Run 'saptune daemon start' to enable tuned at boot.
[FAIL]  No solutions or notes applied           --> Run 'saptune solution|note apply <id>' to configure saptune.
